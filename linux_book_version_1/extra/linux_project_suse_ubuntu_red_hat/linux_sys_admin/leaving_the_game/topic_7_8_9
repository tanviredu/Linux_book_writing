			=> su [switch user command this command help to switch user]

			we can switch user from one user to another with this commmand

			we have to keepo in the mind that


			=>if the root user go to another account it does not need any password
			=> if user need to switch account password is needed
			=> if the user want to switch to root account password is needed

			switch user is easy
			command is
			=> su - <username>




										/etc/skel folder
							__________________________________________


					this is the share folder 
					whatever the user do do it is not going to share
					in other word one user or any user can never see the resource
					of the root user

					but there is one exception of the rule is the

					/etc/skel folder.this folder is accually made for sharing
					and it can be accessible only by the root
					and whatever the root is saving in this folder other 
					user can access the resources.just like a share folder




							creating  group in linux
						____________________________________



		we can create a group of user and give them certain permission and 
		policy to act so we dont have to give the the permission to 
		all individual user .this is like a vlan accuallt in the networking
		specific group get specfic privileges





		user group is sored in the following folder

		=> cat /etc/group


		actually in this folder not only group but also user are in the file
		all in the same file by default just like the vlan



		first create a group first

		groupadd <group name>

		excample:
		------------------
		=>groupadd sales1
		=>groupadd sales2
		=>groupadd sales3


		now every group has a group id 


		we will see the group file in the
		=> cat /etc/group


		we will see the new group with an id 
		we can change the id and the id is after the 1000
		beacause they are created by the root user not the system

		so to change the id of the group (because we can decide to keep the
		group id between a certain limit)



		changin group id is

		=>gruopmod -g <id_number> <group_name>

		=>groupmod -g 5000 sales1


		//remember the small letter .its case senstive 

		[but remember after the  group id is changed if you create another group new group
		will have the id just after the id you set like 50001]




							to delete the group
						______________________________

		to delete the group just like the userdel
		the command is groupdel


		=>groupdel <group_name>



		then see weather the group is deleted o not 

		=>cat /etc/group



					ADDING MEMBER TO THE GROUP
			__________________________________________


			=> usermod -G <group_name> <user_name>


			but you can add a user to multiple group

			because a member can also be a member to multiple group

			=>groupmod -G <list+_of_group> <username>

			example:

			=> groupmod -G sales1,sales2,sales3 tanvir







			DELETING A USER FROM TA SPECFIC GROUP
		----------------------------------------------

		=> gpasswd -d <user_name> <group_name>

		example:


		=>gpasswd -d tanvir sales1





					important command lock the user and unlock the user
				_______________________________________________________________


		if you are the root user you can acctally lock user so they cant login


		=> usermod -L <username>

		example:

		=>usermod -L tanvir




		if we locak the user the user cant login and the
		prompt that the password is incorrent even it is right
		so the user wont know  what is the real reason



									unlock the user
						___________________________________________

			=>usermod -U <username>

			excample:

			=>usermod -U tanvir

				

						changing by editing
				--------------------------------------

				we can actiually change all of them by editing 
				this group file by and editor maby vim 
				editing group file as a special command
				and to execute this command you have to be root


				=>vigr

				now after editing this file exit with :wq


				then make the change to take an effect just logout 
				and relogin











							id command of the user
					______________________________________________


				id command will give the groupid,userid

			=>id <user_name>
			=>id tanvir




						default shell changes
				______________________________________


	you must be root user to do this thing 


	many user can  like different different shell
	like 
	->bash
	->sh
	->ksh
	->csh


	if you want to set the default shell

	command is
	=>usermod -s <shellpath> <username>
	=>usermod -s /bin/csh tanvir



	acctually not only shell you can run any program but if the programm is 
	finished the user will be logout from the session .so it is a good idea to
	set a shell because shell is the program that can run other program





	you can see which shell is allcated is

	cat /etc/passwd
